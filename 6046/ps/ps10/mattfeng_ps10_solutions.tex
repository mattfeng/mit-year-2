\subsection*{(a)}
We note that the maximum of routers that
may remain on in any $4 \times 4$ grid,
no matter how many routers are available,
is $9$.

Thus, we only need to check all subsets of the
$n$ routers that are size $9$ or less.

We can do this in $O(n^9)$ time, which is polynomial
in the number of routers.
