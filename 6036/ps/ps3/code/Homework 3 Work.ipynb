       "               'My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I\\'ve been singing its praises, I\\'m sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren\\'t going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don\\'t normally have that fake finish.  It\\'s the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can\\'t imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It\\'s a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don\\'t find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we\\'ve also tried out a few of Keurig\\'s other offerings.  It\\'s really hit-and-miss in terms of what you\\'ll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G\">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can\\'t go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM\">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I\\'ve tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE\">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we\\'ve tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn\\'t weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don\\'t like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW\">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I\\'m Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton\\'s coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn\\'t work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig\\'s own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It\\'s definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can\\'t go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can\\'t wait to try out the new pods we\\'re set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig\\'s website.')]),\n",

I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.

The lemongrass was picked in Thailand (lemongrass is widely used in Thailand for many cooking recipes). I order any product from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf online since there are no Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf stores near where I live. If you want to try other excellent teas from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, try these two Limited Edition teas sold directly from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's website, Spring Peach Oolong and Blueberry Peach Green Tea. The Spring Peach Oolong was grown 5,000 feet above sea level in the mountains of Thailand and the Blueberry Peach Green Tea was grown 1,200 meters above sea level in the Mae Salong region of Thailand. Besides the three teas I've mentioned from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, I also highly recommend their special Dutch Chocolate Powder, Vanilla Caramel flavored coffee, Raspberry Cream flavored coffee, and Limited Edition Blueberry Streusel flavored coffee. In summary, this is a great chamomile tea. Another great chamomile tea to try is Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile. I was introduced to the Fairmont Egyptian Chamomile tea in 2010 when my sister and I dined at the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's Pyramid restaurant (a restaurant with a fresh market concept and with the largest hotel/restaurant herb and vegetable garden in the Dallas region). I visited the Fairmont Dallas Hotel's gift shop and they had an excellent array of organic teas with their Egyptian Chamomile being one of them. The Egyptian Chamomile has a nice sweet taste and it's sold on fairmontstore.com in their online gift store, the tea section. I strongly recommend the Fairmont's Organic Hawaiian Kei Lani Orange Pineapple, Organic Chinese Jasmine Butterfly #1, and Organic U.S.A.'S Cascade Peppermint teas. Anyways, I'm glad that this Lemon Chamomile tea from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is available for purchase on Amazon. I think it's a great economical deal to purchase this from Amazon - you get a pack of three containers (each containing 20 tea bags). I have one container at home, one at my workplace, and I gave one container to my sister. I'm satisfied with this purchase.\")]),\n",

I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn\\'t thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn\\'t the issue.

My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I\\'ve been drinking a dollar store brand called \"Eight O\\'Clock\" that\\'s of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you\\'d like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle\\'s Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo).

The reality is that your body has a built-in pH regulating system in your lungs and your kidneys. Want to increase your blood pH? Breathe faster. But even then, when you stop thinking about it, your brain will regulate your breathing and your kidneys will adjust to make your blood pH whatever your body wants it to be. You may be able to cause some short-term changes in your blood pH by changing the pH of your water. But your lungs will quickly compensate. You may see some differences in your stomach pH and thus some relief of indigestion similar to taking an antacid. But if you are having gastrointestinal symptoms from acid, you probably shouldn't be treating with alkaline water but should seek medical help to see if you have something more serious going on or should get some more effective antacid medications that have fewer side effects than alkaline antacids.

This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in \\'07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.

So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn\\'t resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren\\'t familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are \"clear.\"  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G\">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I\\'m in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product. My husband only wishes that the cherry flavor came in this deal, but hey, that means I get to use all of them.')]),\n",

It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink. This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this \"natural\" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to \"switch\" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn\\'t a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.  If this is your first try at the Switch fruit sodas, I suggest trying the tangerine variety first, as it really better encapsulates the bright flavors of fresh fruit that I think the company is trying to achieve.')]),\n",

And I\\'m always happy when I can snag a food item that we want to try, but not pay money for something we might not like. With food prices the way they are today, you can all understand.<br /><br />So I was thrilled be be able to review the new Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey Cookies!<br /><br />The Newtons Thins line is a new line of delicious, cripsy cookies made with the goodness of real fruit and 8g of whole grains per serving. There are four choices: Fig and Honey, Blueberry and Brown Sugar, Raspberry and CHocolate and Cranberry Citrus and Oats.<br /><br />We all like figs, so i opted to go with the Fig and Honey, as Kiddo REALLY likes fig newtons, and with Summer around the corner, I wanted to see if these would be a good option for a summer snack!<br /><br />First off, I was happy that the package has a resealable (fold-over ties) top- no having to use an extra bag or container to keep the cookies fresh- yeah!<br /><br />Secondly, I was surprised at how large the cookies were each! Healthy cookies usually equate to smaller sizes! The cookies are crisp (as they are thin) and have bits of dried fruit instead of a fruit filling, like tradition Newtons.<br /><br />Even Kiddo was impressed that the cookies tasted good! Now admittedly she said she liked the traditional Newtons better, but then she\\'s four and likes the fruit filling ooiness the best! The adults were split on which they liked better. I think it would depend on what you were in the mood for. We even considered grinding up the cookies for a crust for a cheesecake (but didn\\'t get around to it before too many were gone). I think they would be great as a crust for cookie bars as well! Definitely recommend this for kids and adults!<br /><br />Disclosure / Disclaimer: I received this product for review purposes, free of charge, from the Amazon Vine Program !

Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar.

For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I\\'m pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find \"packed on\" and \"best before\" date.

Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane\\'s primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as \"organic.\" Do a little research; \"cold-pressed,\" \"organic,\" AND \"hexane-free\" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I\\'m not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I\\'ve actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn\\'t found it on sale at a good price.

Well...<br /><br />It tastes sort of like carbonated strawberry or grape, a slight pucker-inducing dull fruity taste. Not bad, just not delicious. It\\'s sort of par for the course when it comes to energy drinks. If you like Monster, Amp or Red Bull, this should be just fine. If you drink your coffee black, this will be a huge improvement unless you just love that mud-like taste.<br /><br />As far as energy, this has about the same effect on me as the Monster and Amp line of energy drinks: it gives me a subtle energy boost, and that\\'s a good thing. Red Bull leaves me feeling wired and edgy and I don\\'t want to waste the extra kick by sitting around vibrating, feeling restless and hating how my skin feels like it\\'s crawling. The caffeine in a can of this is on the low end of an average cup of coffee, but it\\'s also loaded up with taurine, l-carnitine and arginine, as well as things like vitamins B and C--things that seem to have some other potential health benefits other than just getting me through an afternoon energy slump (assuming there\\'s enough of those things in there to be useful).<br /><br />Overall, I give this 3 stars. It does the job, doesn\\'t taste unpleasant or leave a nasty after-taste, and falls within the price range I\\'m accustomed to with other similar energy drinks.

       "               'My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially very leery of purchasing this particular flavor.  The combination, particularly for a powder based beverage, sounded like a disaster in the making.  In the end, I can say that it was better than expected.  In terms of flavor, I think a kid (or the kid at heart) would enjoy this more than an adult.<br /><br />Some notes on flavor, color, and packaging:<br /><br />Flavor:  Compared to other Crystal Light beverages, the flavor of strawberry orange banana is actually quite complex.  You can taste each of those flavors in the beverage.  While a fine combination of flavors, something about it screams \"kid\".  It is just not what I would serve to a fellow adult on a hot day.<br /><br />Color: Like many of the flavors in the Crystal Light Light, the Strawberry Orange Banana is a rather vibrant color once mixed; it is a deep pink color.  It looks very artificial (which, admittedly, this beverage is).  If color is important to you, Crystal Light does have some subtlety colored options.  For example, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> looks like cloudy water but tastes like mint and lime.<br /><br />Packaging: One negative with all of the Crystal Light products relates to packaging. First, the container is a #5 plastic. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. I know Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don\\'t live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with. Additionally, if you like Crystal Light, it can be very easy to go through these containers quickly. Some Crystal Light flavors, like the strawberry orange banana, have six packets and others have five. The container could hold more flavor packets, which would reduce the overall number of containers that the user has to dispose of.<br /><br />Overall, a fine beverage that is encased in packaging that is not very green. If you are looking for a more adult option, I would suggest <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC\">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9RY\">Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix (10-Quart), 3.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9OC\">Crystal Light Pink Lemonade Drink Mix (8-Quart), 1.9-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />3.5 - 4 stars')]),\n",

Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that \"weird taste\" to it, however it doesn\\'t altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I\\'d say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn\\'t lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.<br /><br />I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don\\'t do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won\\'t need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.<br /><br />The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I\\'d say give it a shot. If you\\'re a big coffee snob, then it\\'s probably not for you. For the record I\\'m a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn\\'t go out of my way to order it, I wouldn\\'t turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there.')]),\n",

I am utterly delighted with this product!<br /><br />Just as an interesting aside, the genus name of \"Salvia\" for chia is derived from the Latin \"salvere,\"  meaning \"to save.\"  The Mayan word \"chiabaan\" from which chia gets its common name means \"strengthening.\"  So you can understand how these tiny seeds get their reputation for packing an astonishing nutritional punch.  Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and have long been considered an energy tonic.  The native peoples of the Americas have used chia since ancient times for endurance and also to treat constipation.<br /><br />There is apparently no difference in nutrition between black or white chia seeds but the lighter colored white chia seeds are preferable in recipes where the food presentation is enhanced by their more neutral coloring.<br /><br />Having gone raw vegan some years back, chia seeds are very popular with me (as are flax seeds) for substituting the grains in my dehydrated raw crackers, breads and sweet treats.  I use chia seeds as I use flax seeds, or in combination with flax seeds, for the same mucilaginous effect of being \"sticky\" enough to hold together when dehydrated, making a very reasonable and tasty facsimile of  a cracker, bread or sweet treat.<br /><br />Chia seeds, especially these <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM\">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a>, make a wonderful pudding that reminds me of tapioca pudding.  I also sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chia seeds over my sprouted buckwheat cereal and the thickening effect of the chia when I add liquid transforms my cereal into a very appealing, very nourishing porridge.  For added nutrition in my smoothies I also add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds.<br /><br />I am very pleased with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054TWQMM\">Nutiva Organic White Chia Seeds, 14-Ounce, 2-Count Pouches</a> and look forward to devising more creative culinary applications for this delicious, certified organic product of Mexico in my raw vegan kitchen.  Of course chia seeds are not confined to the raw or vegetarian kitchens alone.  Every diet should include these mightily nourishing, antioxidant and fiber rich seeds.  The ancient Aztec and Mayan peoples revered these seeds... and perhaps we modern people should too!')]),\n",

It took my dog less than 10 minutes to figure out that he could just grab the ring with his canines, while pinning the ball to the ground with his paws on the nylon bone on either side, and just using brute force to pull the ring until it snaps off. Gone in less than a minute. He\\'s not interested in chewing on the nylon ends, and he could care less about that large heavy ball. Can\\'t say I blame him.<br /><br />I started cutting thick chews in half and drilling a hole through the center, larger than the core of the toy.

If you haven\\'t completed your toy purchase, get this one. It cleans their teeth, massages their gums, and conceals everything but the edge of the ring. Within 5 minutes he had cracked the middle piece that houses the bristles with his powerful jaws. The toy is still usable, although it does lose bristles. However, it only slowed him down by a few minutes.<br /><br />Now I cut 3/8\" off the outside of the rings, and cut that into smaller pieces to hide between the bristles on the other side, and use as special mini-treats.

       "               \"Tamaki short grain rice is available in different varieties.  This particular variety is brown.  ANY rice not white is brown,<br />even black and red. The distinction is not truly one of color, it references bran.  White rice is white because the bran (the best,<br />most healthful part of the rice grain) is removed completely.  What makes the Tamaki Haiga type of rice so desirable is that the<br />grain itself is just as light as a white rice would be AND it still has the bran germ intact.  This difference makes for an incredible<br />difference in taste.  Where white rice (with perhaps the exception of Basmati) is largely bland and flavorless and requires spices, herbs<br />and or fats to make it worth your while, Tamaki Haiga has the bran AND the flavor.  Oh and although it is a short grain variety, (which being<br />thicker also takes longer to cook than white) it does cook in much shorter time than the average brown rice.<br /><br />If you are eating this rice and not noticing a real difference in flavor (it should have a noticeable nutty flavor)then perhaps you are not preparing<br />it properly.  Contrary to the average white rice it does require soaking.  I have found that after proper rinsing soaking my haiga for 30 minutes<br />or so before turning my rice cooker on leads to a perfectly moist and flavorful dish.<br /><br />Remember also, this is a sushi type rice and is meant to be moist and sticky as opposed to the firm and easily separated texture of the average white rice.<br />This truly is a superior rice product and JVS has proven to be a reliable distributor.  They deliver fresh product, well packaged and on time.  I agree that<br />the price for this rice is a bit high but this vendor makes it available at a much cheaper price than some others. And don't forget that the shipping that they are<br />charging is seriously discounted.  All in all a very good deal for rice that is actually good for you AND really good tasting as well.

I try a few others here and there, and usually drink more hot tea in the winter months.<br /><br />I normally drink the foil pack single serving bigelow, and I even get the de-caf version if I'm having a late night dessert!  Can't eat dessert without Earl Grey!<br /><br />Anyway, the good news is that the tea bag did not leak any leaves and the tag didn't fall off the string!  Other than that, and after steeping per the directions, I still felt that there was no punch to the tea; it was kind of bland.  I use an artificial sweetener in my tea, and sometimes, depending on my mood, I use the liquid vanilla coffeemate, which doesn't cover up the taste of the tea, and in my opinion, it adds to the flavor.<br /><br />However, when using it with this tea, there really was no sense of the Earl Grey; covered up the bergamot and it also has lemon in it, which I normally don't find in my Earl Grey be it decaf or leaded!<br /><br />So, overall, I don't think I would go out of my way to find this brand. I didn't find it disgusting, but not much to get excited about.  I do like the 6 boxes for the low price on Amazon and as also like that I can get an extra 15% discount with the subscribe and save program.  I would not, however, sign up for it for this product.

First you take out the amount of fish you will need to cook depending on the size of your family. Next you wash and put your fish in a big bowl with enough water to cover it in the bowl.  Let sit for overnight.  Next day when you are ready to begin cooking, you will pour off the water on fish and get a pot and once again place fish in pot with enough water to cover it and let it cook for ten minutes then pour off boiling water and putting tap water on the fish again.  Use this time to debone the fish and break it into small pieces taste fish to see if it is too salty to taste, if it is soak it in water for half an hour more or boil it for ten more minutes.  Be warned that salted cod fish shrinks when cooked.  If fish is  to your taste then you will need an onion sliced,three plum tomatoes or nine cherry tomatoes sliced drain water from fish, heat skillet  and add some cooking oil and saute onion and tomatoes then add fish and stir every thing together.  Add black pepper and then add a little water so as to make a little sauce.  You can tweak the taste by adding a little garlic to the mix, putting it in at the same time as onion and tomatoes. You can eat this cooked up fish with bread and pita chips or on a bed of steamed white rice.')]),\n",

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.')]),\n",

When I smelled the unused pod, as well as the brewing coffee, I thought \"Hmmm, that doesn\\'t smell too great.\" But wow, the result is a really nice cup of coffee. One Love is not at all bitter, and I wouldn\\'t even call it bold. It is mild to medium in taste, while not being weak at all.

I took my first swallow out of the can and was just completely turned-off by just how sweet the beverage actually is. Served over ice and allowed to sit for a minute made it a good bit more tolerable, but when I grab something to drink, I want to drink it right then, not 5 minutes or so later. It doesn't taste bad, mind you, it's just way too sweet, almost overpoweringly so. A quick glance at the can says it all...33 grams of sugar...6 more than the same serving size of Coca-Cola.

It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down.

I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula.

I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets!

Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor.

I asked around and looked around, but couldn't find anything on its ingredient list.  Being that it was by far the cheapest option on Amazon for coconut water, I jumped on a case.  It tastes pretty good, but pretty sweet too.  If that's your thing, than you'll love it.  However, I was disappointed by the ingredients list: young coconut juice, water, young coconut pulp, sugar, sodium metabisulphite (for color retention).  It tastes reminiscent of sugar water with a coconut background.  By comparison the Nirvana product I've been buying (pure coconut water) has 15 g of sugar / 16 oz. or about 1 g/oz.  Parrot has 24 g / 11.5 oz. or about 2 g/oz.  In other words, they've doubled the sugar content of an already sweet beverage.  24 g of sugar is still substantially less than a can of pop though at 40-60 g.  So if you're looking for a sweet beverage to replace a can of pop for you or someone else, this could be a good option, but I think the natural coconut water is sweet enough and didn't need alteration.  The addition of sugar water is probably what decreases the price to create such a competitive price.  Nirvana (for example) doesn't have any added preservatives either.  You can learn more about sodium metabisulphite here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The 16 oz Nirvana (as compared to the 11.5 oz Parrot) has the same calories, 0.5 g more fat, same carbs, 1.7 g protein (0 g for Parrot), 6% calcium (2% for Parrot), 8% vitamin C (15% for Parrot), and 6% iron (4% for Parrot).  The Nirvana product is also more expensive at $2/16 oz can vs. 0.50 cents/11.5 oz can for Parrot.  About 11cents for Nirvana or 4.5cents per oz for Parrot.

       "               'This product is very good. I follow the directions exactly and mix it with water.. I havent tried mixing it w/ jelly or honey or anything else, as some others have suggested; the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted a lower calorie, lower fat alternative to regular peanut butter, so for me, mixing it with 150 calories worth of jelly doesnt make any sense.<br /><br />In any case, this is definitely NOT exactly like regular peanut butter.. the consistency is a little different, but I suppose you could adjust that to your own liking by adding more or less water. Also, you can definitely tell that this is a lower fat product than regular peanut butter; I mean, when you take a tablespoon of regular peanut butter, you can instantly taste and sense the richness due to the fat content, and when you eat PB2, you definitely notice the difference. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, just different. Its almost the same as if you are used to eating super premium, high fat ice cream, and then one day you switch to low fat; the low fat may still taste very good, but because you are so used to eating the high fat stuff, you will instantly notice a difference-- however, once you get used to it, it wont bother you.<br /><br />I would say PB2 is the same... its definitely NOT the exact same taste / texture as regular peanut butter, but its still very good. it has a very fresh, \"clean\" taste. in my opinion, its DEFINITELY worth the compromise, considering the huge amount of fat and calories in regular peanut butter, and how much healthier PB2 is in comparison . I have cravings for peanut butter just about every day, but up to now, I have only allowed myself to eat regular peanut butter about once a week, due to the fat and calorie content...  but now, since finding PB2, I allow myself to have it whenever I want it.<br /><br />By the way.. I tried the PB2 Chocolate version-- I ordered a sample from their website-- it was OK.. not fabulous, not bad. to me, if I am going to really \"go for it\" and eat chocolate peanut butter anything, its not going to be a low fat version, because its just not worth it. in other words, if I had a craving for a Reeses peanut butter cup, chocolate PB2 would not satisfy that craving. On the other hand, when I have craving for regular peanut butter-- in a sandwich or right off of a spoon, regular PB2 will satisfy that craving without wrecking my diet. Bottom line: if you arent sure whether or not you will like this product, go to the Bell Plantation website and spend the four bucks and order a sample, and give it a try, then you will know for sure before you commit to buying 4 jars plus shipping. ( and folks, the shipping costs almost as much as the 4 jars, so make sure you like this before you order it! )<br /><br />My final verdict is I am pretty sure I will be replacing regular peanut butter with PB2 for as long as they keep making it, and will probably order it by the case in the future to save on shipping.')]),\n",

(up to overnight) Whether that liquid is milk of any kind,yogurt, water, whatever. The rule for servings is a 1:2 ratio of cereal to liquid. Other than the slight preparation time needed, this cereal is surprisingly good for a healthy cereal. A little more calories than your sugary Kellogs or General Mills cereal and takes a tiny bit of getting used to, but those calories come in more GOOD carbs and fats instead of nothing but bad carbs and sugar like other types of cereal.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it is very versatile. I haven't tried the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the bags yet but I've heard that it's good. And it would not hurt at all to add any kind of fruit of your liking to this cereal, chopped apples, blueberries, cherries, bananas etc. And you can eat it hot like oatmeal or cold. I would NOT buy this cereal however if you do not like sunflower seeds because, as others have said, there is a very noticeable amount of them in it.<br /><br />I did not expect this cereal to be good at all so honestly I bought it planning on it to be horrible. (was going to bear it out anyways due to the fact that I'm on a diet and want to have as a filling yet quick breakfast as possible without breaking my calorie consumption bank)I do add about 2 teaspoons of sugar or honey to mine, but Turns out that Bob's Red Mill Muesli is nothing that has to be borne. Don't get me wrong, not close to as good taste-wise compared to my oldtime favorites cinnamon toast crunch and captain crunch, but if you're looking for a healthier cereal that gets you through to lunch time without hunger at less than 350 calories including WHOLE milk and the optional honey or sugar,(so it would be even less if you're using 2% or fat free/skim/soy milk) then this is definitely the cereal for you. I'm about to purchase an order of the larger bags myself on subscribe & save. Those 40OZ bags are more than twice the cereal at less than twice the price so it is a better value but if you're not sure if you'll like this cereal, then these 18OZ bags will do as a trial order, as that's what I did.<br /><br />**Also I would like to add that the one serving size on the bag of 1/4th of a cup of cereal is ridiculous.

Normally I do not care much for French Roast because it is over cooked in my opinion.<br /><br />I drank it black to get a good sense of the flavor. Since it is darkly roasted it doesn\\'t have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and, of course, a strong coffee flavor. I tend to drink my coffee a bit on the strong side anyway - a tablespoon heaped a little per ~12 oz of water.<br /><br />For the last several years I\\'ve been brewing my coffee a cup at a time with a Melitta #4 filter and a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S\">Melitta Ready Set Joe/Mug 64010 Coffee Makers Speciality</a> (although I bought just the filter cone) and an electric kettle. If you\\'ve never tried it this method is the only way you\\'ll get a great cup of coffee every single time. I had a liter thermos and a different filter cone and brewed it by the pot this way too. Excellent coffee every time.<br /><br />At any rate, I mention that to say this - for pre-ground coffee this is a pretty good cup of coffee. I\\'d be willing to bet that the Columbian roast is excellent too.<br /><br />For those of you that think \\'eh coffee is coffee\\' I\\'ve got two words for you ... \\'Chase Sanborn\\' Ug.

Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity.
