* Use expression profiles to weight edges
    * This would be for a healthy person
    * See which genes are associated with tissue specificity
* And then look at which genes are in diseases, and see how they propogate in the healthy person graph
* Measuring propagation
    * Compactness
    * 
Why do different perturbations end with the same symptoms --
possible explanation is downstream the interactions converge.


Another possibility:
* Combine topology and some kind of dynamics
